### Directory Structure

The `video_app` folder should contain the folder `Model` that contains model data.

Example setup:

- video_app
    - Model
        - assets/ (Optional)
        - variables/ (Optional)
        - saved_model.pb

### Git

Github contains a maximum individual file size of 100 MB.
It is very possible that model weights may exceed 100 MB.
For this reason, any content within the `video_app/Model` will not be tracked by git.
